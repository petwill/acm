My bug list

1. maxm v.s. maxn be careful
2. check if maxn is too small ( check all declared size )
3. debug("%d\n", KM()) ==> will not execute KM() when submitted, 
   or the function is never called..(stupid..
4. multiple testcases => init again every time!!
5. check typo with symmetrically ~~ (usually things like x, y, z or a, b, c ... single character typo
